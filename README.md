# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage was developed as a study tool and will provide key information to full stack web development bootcamp students as they prepare for the classes, quizzes, and projects. It solves the problem of organizing the extensive amount of information being presented and making that information accessible to anyone. I learned the basics of using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.

## Usage

Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
