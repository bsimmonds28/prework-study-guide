        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is meant to give the content structure.</li>
          <li>At the very top, we see the !DOCTYPE html declaration. This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened. This particular !DOCTYPE html declaration is letting the browser know to expect HTML on the page.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
            <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. They are useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
            <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a 'style element' in the head element. This internal CSS style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
            <li>Inline CSS and internal 'style' sheets are totally acceptable methods under certain conditions, but the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
            <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project. To access Git, we use the command line. However, Git commands are not the same as the bash commands such as cd and mkdir that we use to navigate and create directories or perform other tasks. Git commands always start with git and are used to save and track versions of your code. Using Git commands, we can initiate (or create) a repo, add our code to the repo, and view the different versions of our code, which are each stored in a unique commit.</li>
            <li>Git is great for tracking changes locally on your own computer, but to collaborate with others, you need to use another tool, GitHub. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely. Using GitHub not only allows us to store our code, but also to easily collaborate with others.</li>
            <li>It is important to note that while GitHub is popular, there are other Git-based repository hosting services, such as Bitbucket and SourceForge. However, for this course, we will use GitHub, which is free, to share work and collaborate.</li>
            <li>touch script.js - create a new file inside the assets folder</li>
            <li>git checkout -b feature/add-js: create a new branch for the JavaScript file</li>
            <li>cd - navigate to folder</li>
            <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
            <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>In coding parlance, a variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
            <li>A method is a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer.</li>
            <li>Chrome DevTools: right-click anywhere in the browser window and select "Inspect" from the menu, select console.</li>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
            <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. Just like its name sounds, when using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true. When the computer encounters an if statement in a JavaScript file, it will check to see if the condition that we provide is truthy. If it is, then it will do whatever action we ask it to do in between the curly brackets. If the condition isn’t true or has a value that isn’t truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and move on.</li>
            <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false. All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy.</li>
            <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
            <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way. Arrays are not limited to contain only a single type of data. A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on.</li>
            <li>To work with individual data items inside an array, we need to have one more piece of information: the location of the data item in the array. This location is identified with a unique number called an index. In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1.</li>
            <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional if statement that we just learned, to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times. In order to use the for loop, we need the shape's index and the array's length.</li>
            <li>We can find the length of an array by using a built-in property of an array, appropriately named length.</li>
            <li>The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1.</li>
            <li>Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it, just in case you need it later. To comment out multiple lines of JavaScript code, put /* before and */ after the block of code.</li>
            <li>To declare a function, we use the function keyword and then give our function a unique name followed by parentheses. Then we add curly brackets {} that contain the code for the task we want to perform. In our example, we created two separate functions: one for our for loop and one for our if statement.</li>
            <li>To randomize our selection, we need to use a special Math function that helps us select a random number. Math.floor() and Math.random() are both properties of JavaScript's built-in Math object that can be used together to generate a random number.</li>
